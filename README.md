Purpose
-------

To promote the free and open development of an FPGA based Bitcoin mining solution.

http://www.weusecoins.com/

http://bitcoin.org/


Project Status
--------------

Project is fully functional and allows mining of Bitcoins both in a Pool and Solo.
It can also support Namecoin mining with a minor modification (tested but not documented).

**Current Performance:** 80 MHash/s

*Note: The included default configuration file, and source files, are built for
50 MHash/s performance (downclocked). This is meant to prevent damage to your valuable
chip if you don't provide an appropriate cooling solution.*


Installation Instructions
-------------------------


### Required Equipment:
* DE2-115 Development Kit (this is *not* a DE2. It has a Cyclone IV EP4CE115.)
* USB Cable
* Windows PC (Linux is also supported, but not documented)
* Altera's Quartus II (installed on PC)


###Instructions:

####Do These Once:

1) *IMPORTANT*: Please remove the clear acrylic cover on your DE2-115 board. This will restrict
air flow and may cause the chip to overheat.

2) Navigate to 'scripts/mine' and EDIT 'mine.tcl' (open in Notepad or other text editor)

3) Locate the following lines:

    set url "http://btcguild.com:8332"
    set userpass "youremailhere@example.com:yourpasswordhere"


Edit accordingly (N.B. the script has only been tested with btcguild and deepbit so far).

4) Save and close 'mine.tcl'

####Do these each time you want to run the miner:

1) Connect the DE2-115 Development Kit to your PC through USB, connect its power, and turn it on.

2) Ensure that the DE2-115's drivers have been installed successfully on your PC.
Consult the DE2-115 User Guide for more information on setting up the DE2-115.

3) Navigate to 'scripts/program' and run 'program-fpga-board.bat'.

4) Follow the instructions provided by the program-fpga-board script.
Select the correct cable and programming file.
Once programming has succeeded, the DE2-115 is now ready to mine!

*Note: This script sometimes fails immediately upon execution. Please try running it again.*

5) Run 'mine.bat'

6) If working correctly, 'mine.bat' will leave a console window open which will fill with diagnostic information as it runs.

7) Profit!


####Notes:
* You need to re-program the DE2-115 every time it is powered off and on again. Repeat steps 1 through 7 for subsequent uses.
* Your PC needs to stay on and connected to the internet. It is acting like a controller for the FPGA,
feeding it data and getting back valid hashes.


Thank You!

Donations are most welcome! They will be used to buy more equipment. I'm currently trying to get
an ethernet module up and running so the miner can run all on its own.
